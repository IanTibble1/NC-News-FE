# News API

**<u>Project Overview</u>**

This project is the front-end portion of a news application that aims to mirror web serivces that typically request and display data from back-end architecture. The app aims to serve news articles that can be selected, read and voted upon by users. Users are also able to leave comments on individual articles. As authentication has not been implemented into the project at this time, a hard-coded user has been initalised to allow for demonstration of functionality.

The hosted version of this project can be visited here: https://nc-news-react-app.netlify.app/

The github repo for the front-end of this project is available at: https://github.com/IanTibble1/nc-news-react

The back-end api that I created to provide the data for this app can be accessed here: https://news-server-1ny4.onrender.com/api/

The github repo for the back-end is available at: https://github.com/IanTibble1/my-nc-news
